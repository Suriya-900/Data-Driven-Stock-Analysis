📝 Problem Statement
The project focuses on providing a comprehensive analysis of Nifty 50 stocks based on their historical data, including:

Daily stock prices: open, close, high, low, and volume.

Key performance insights: top-performing and worst-performing stocks.

Visualizations and dashboards for tracking stock trends and making informed investment decisions.

🚀 Approach
Data Extraction and Transformation:
Data Source: Data is organized in YAML format, with each month's data in separate folders.

Transformation: The data is extracted, transformed, and saved in CSV format for each stock symbol, resulting in 50 CSV files for all symbols.

Data Analysis and Visualization:
The project analyzes the stock performance across various key metrics and visualizations:

Top 10 Green Stocks: Stocks with the highest yearly return.

Top 10 Loss Stocks: Stocks with the lowest yearly return.

Market Summary: Overall market stats, including average price and volume, and the number of green vs. red stocks.

Detailed Analysis:
Volatility Analysis:

Measure the volatility (standard deviation) of daily returns to assess stock price fluctuations.

Visualization: Bar chart of the top 10 most volatile stocks.

Cumulative Return Over Time:

Calculate the cumulative return of each stock from the beginning to the end of the year.

Visualization: Line chart showing the top 5 performing stocks based on cumulative return.

Sector-wise Performance:

Analyze stock performance by sector and calculate the average yearly return for each sector.

Visualization: Bar chart of average yearly returns by sector.

Stock Price Correlation:

Calculate correlation between stock prices to understand how stocks move together.

Visualization: Heatmap of the correlation matrix between stock prices.

Top 5 Gainers and Losers (Month-wise):

Track monthly performance and show the top 5 gainers and losers for each month.

Visualization: Monthly bar charts displaying top 5 gainers and losers.
